#  Project Panel

This one is pretty straight forward. This is just Unity's version of the File Explorer.

The Project Panel window displays all the files and folders we have included in our project. Every file that we use in our project can be navigated through the Project Panel.

We can get a more detailed view of the Project Panel by clicking on the context button which is on the top-right of the window and selecting **One column Layout** or **Two-column Layout**.

We can use Ctrl + 9 to open the Project Panel window.
