#  Hierarchy

 The Hierarchy section in Unity is where all the Game objects(cameras, sprites, managers(UI, Audio, etc.), lights) used in the scene are visible.

 Hierarchy makes it easy for sorting game objects or club them together in a parent object. It is also easy for removing and add game objects from Hierarchy rather than the Scene view.
 
 You can press Ctrl + 4 to open the Hierarchy window.
