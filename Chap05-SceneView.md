#  Scene View

This view is what your eyes will be glued to most of the time. You will set up stuff, test if something is broken, and fix it all in the scene view.

The **Scene View** is where you can interact with the game objects visually. You can manipulate, select and modify the game GameObjects as per your project requirements. The Scene view can show a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on the type of project. 

Use all the *ToolBar* options in the **scene view** to interact with the game objects.

Feel free to play around here. Get comfortable with manipulating objects and shortcuts. Have fun, I'll see you in the next section!
