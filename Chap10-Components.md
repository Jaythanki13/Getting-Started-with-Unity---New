# Components

- Every game object has different components depending upon the type of game object we have created. Components in a game object allow us to perform certain actions with our game object during the scene. Some of the highly used components have been mentioned below:
    - Transform: It is one of the main components of a game object. We cannot remove a transform component from our game object, every game object has a transform component. There are 3 sub-components under the transform component which are Position - it helps in updating positions of game objects in respective axes depending on the type of game(3D or 2D).
    Rotation - it helps in updating rotations of the game object.
    Scale - it helps in changing the size of the game object in the respective axes.
    - Rigidbody: What is the use of a game if we are not able to make our player Jump, run or move our player in a certain way?? ü§î That‚Äôs what the Rigidbody component is here for. Rigidbody allows us to add physics to our game object to make it more realistic.
    - Collider: Ever wondered how a player can stand on the ground in the game and not go past right through it?? ü§î That‚Äôs because we have a collider attached to every game object that doesn‚Äôt allow them to pass through the ground and let them stand on the ground.
    - Script: Scripts are mostly used to write the code for the game we create. But what code do we write? Say, you want the player to input the RIGHT Arrow ‚û°Ô∏è key from the keyboard and the game object would move from left to right. How would you make that happen in a game? Take a pause and think for a while. If you‚Äôve not got the answer then here is one for you. You do that by coding it in scripts. Of course, we will discuss scripts in detail later on.
    - These are some of the main components that are highly used for game dev. Other components include animator, audio listener, sprite renderer, etc. which you can explore and play around with once you have started learning unity.
