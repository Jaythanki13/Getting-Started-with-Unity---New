# Components

## Overview

Let's see if you guys still remember ECS in Unity ü§î. Well if you don't, you can recap everything on the About Unity Section and come back here later on. 

Every game object has different components depending upon the type of game object we have created. Components in a game object allow us to perform certain actions with our game object during the scene. Some of the highly used components have been mentioned below:
     
## Transform
    It is one of the main components of a game object. We cannot remove a transform component from our game object, every game object has a transform component. There are 3 sub-components under the transform component which are

    - Position - it helps in updating positions of game objects in respective axes depending on the type of game(3D or 2D).
    - Rotation - it helps in updating rotations of the game object.
    - Scale - it helps in changing the size of the game object in the respective axes.


## Rigidbody

    Want to make the player jump, double jump, triple jump? all you need is a rigidbody. You can add all kinds of physics to your character, shooting objects. Did I mention you can jump?
    
## Collider

    Ever wondered how a player can stand on the ground in the game and not go past right through it? That‚Äôs because we have a collider attached to every game object that doesn‚Äôt allow them to pass through the ground and let them stand on the ground.

## Script

    Scripts are mostly used to write the code for the game we create. But what code do we write? Say, you want the player to input the RIGHT Arrow ‚û°Ô∏è key from the keyboard and the game object would move from left to right. How would you make that happen in a game? Take a pause and think for a while. If you‚Äôve not got the answer then here is one for you. You do that by coding it in scripts. Of course, we will discuss scripts in detail later on.
    
    These are some of the main components that are highly used for game dev. Other components include animator, audio listener, sprite renderer, etc. which you can explore and play around with once you have started learning unity.

Components are basically modules that you can swap in and out to add certain functionalities to your GameObjects.

You can use all of these modules together to start building your GameObject. 

## Wrapping Up

Covering all the modules over here is going to take too long. Also, I am busy and totally not trying to hide the fact that I don't know what each module does üò∂. Moving on!
