#  Console

##  Overview
This window I particularly have a love hate relationship with. Because on one hand it is probably the most useful window for debugging and at the same time this is where your mistakes are highlighted in red. But you have to do what you gotta do right?

The console is the Window where you can find all the Warnings, Errors & other messages that are generally generated by Unity itself. We refer to all of these messages as logs.

If you are building your own Project and if there are any errors in your scripts, or maybe you want to display some information from the script while playing/testing the game you can use the console window.

## Accessing the Console Window

To Open Console window from Unity Main Menu, Select Window → General → Console

You can also show your own messages in the Console using the Debug class.

Everything that is written to the **Console Window** (by Unity, or your own code) is also written to a Log File.

The Console **toolbar** has options for controlling how messages are displayed, and for searching and filtering messages

The detail area shows the full text of the selected messages

The Console window menu has options for opening Log files, controlling how much of each message is visible in the list, and setting stack trace options

The Console list displays an entry for each logged message.

## Wrapping Up

I know this window might seem innocent first, but you will all end up just like me in some time.
