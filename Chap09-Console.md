#  Console

The console is the Window where you can find all the Warnings, Errors & other messages that are generally generated by Unity itself.

If you are building your own Project and in your Script and if there is any Error or Message that you wanted to Print at Runtime, that Time you can check via Console window for more information

To Open Console window from Unity Main Menu, Select Window → General → Console

You can also show your own messages in the Console using the Debug class.

Everything that is written to the **Console Window** (by Unity, or your own code) is also written to a Log File.

The Console **toolbar** has options for controlling how messages are displayed, and for searching and filtering messages

The detail area shows the full text of the selected messages

The Console window menu has options for opening Log files, controlling how much of each message is visible in the list, and setting stack trace options

The Console list displays an entry for each logged message
