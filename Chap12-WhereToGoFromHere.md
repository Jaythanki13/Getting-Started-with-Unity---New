# Showcase To The World!

## You made it!

Ayyyy Look who made it! Congrats on taking your first step in the industry. 

Pop a bottle of champagne. Party like there is no tomorrow.

Make a lot of noise, let the world know that you have taken your first steps in the industry. Maybe have a music party with your clan members on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/R4hfXhsWjN)?
